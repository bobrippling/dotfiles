# run rsync with -F (alias for `--filter='dir-merge /.rsync-filter`)
# dir-merge specifies a per-directory merge/filter file

# `exclude` these files from the transfer
# `,r` - but don't delete them if present on the Receiver
# `,s` - don't Send the file (not really relevant with `exclude`, but applies if we're going backwards)
# `,p` - Perishable - don't keep a directory alive if it only contains these files

exclude,srp *.sw?
